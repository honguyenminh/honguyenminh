## Hi!

Hi, I'm a nerd who likes weird things. Like, really weird things.

Oh yeah music too, but that doesn't count. Wanna jam, and is in HCM city? Hit me up.

Would code for money.

**Favorite tech:** C#. Kotlin is pretty cool, I just hate the Android/Java build system. Gradle will take 5 business days to "build".

Hate most web technologies with a passion. *JS should be burned in the darkest, deepest flaming floor of hell.*

## Quick words (activist stuffs)

Please, push back on "you will own nothing and be happy".

- **Self host** anything you can. Domain names are cheap (*.io.vn is less than 1USD a year if you're a Vietnamese).

- Encourage **local-first applications**. [Read more](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/local-first/)

- **Buy your media**. Please buy your media. Support the artist, go on Bandcamp or Ototoy and buy their stuff directly. Like a Youtuber? Donate to them straight with Patreon or similar. Spotify will die. Remember that. They haven't made a profit until 2024. They are blitzscaling. Most streaming services barely pay the artists. The money go to the label.

- Use an Adblocker. Please use an Adblocker. Also install SponsorBlock while you're at it. And do not use Chrome. They broke most ad-blocking extensions.

- Doesnt mean you should pirate everything, **pay for software you deem useful**. Or just go open-source/free (they are different).

- **Encourage softwares with less predatory monetization models**. Think FL Studio with lifetime updates, or pay-once software that actually works offline. Subscription-models are a lie. Yes Adobe.
